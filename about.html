    <p>
      I am a passionate and driven <b>B.Tech student</b> specializing in <b>Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering</b> at
      <b>MIT Academy of Engineering, Pune</b>, maintaining a strong academic performance with a CGPA of <b>8.06</b>.
      <br><br>
      My interests lie at the intersection of <b>Embedded Systems, IoT, and Artificial Intelligence</b>, where I focus on creating
      intelligent, efficient, and scalable hardware–software integrated solutions.
      <br><br>
      I have hands-on expertise in <b>STM32 microcontrollers, Arduino, and MATLAB/Simulink</b> for real-time system design and control.
      On the software side, I work with <b>Python, C++, and OpenCV</b> for image processing, automation, and AI-based detection systems.
      <br><br>
      My goal is to contribute to <b>AI-driven embedded systems</b> and <b>smart automation</b> by combining strong engineering principles
      with creative innovation and interdisciplinary learning.
